      <h2 class="whoarewe">Who are we?</h2>
      <p class="p1">
        We are an international organisation, based in countries such as Germany
        🇩🇪, USA 🇺🇸, Canada 🇨🇦, China 🇨🇳, India 🇮🇳, and Australia 🇦🇺, among
        others, dedicated to the exploration and colonization of space. Our
        mission is to advance human presence beyond Earth. The idea of living on
        another planet has long been the stuff of science fiction. From the red
        deserts of Mars to the icy plains of Europa, our imaginations are
        captivated by the possibility of extraterrestrial homes. But imagination
        alone is not enough. Modern science is turning fiction into possibility.
        Space agencies like NASA, private pioneers like SpaceX, and visionary
        thinkers like Elon Musk are laying the groundwork for human settlement
        beyond Earth. Yet the challenges are staggering: extreme temperatures,
        deadly radiation, scarce resources, and the vast distances between
        planets all threaten human life. Could we overcome these obstacles?
        Could we terraform Mars, build self-sustaining habitats, or even travel
        to exoplanets in other star systems? This chapter explores the science,
        the technology, and the audacious vision that may allow humanity to take
        its first steps toward becoming truly multiplanetary. One of the biggest
        focal points is Mars.

      <h2 class="whoarewe">What is our mission?</h2>
      <p class="p1">
        Our mission is to make space travel accessible and sustainable for
        future generations. We aim to develop advanced technologies that will
        enable humans to explore, inhabit, and thrive in space. By fostering
        international collaboration and innovation, we strive to push the
        boundaries of what is possible in space exploration. Through our
        projects, we seek to inspire a new era of discovery and adventure,
        ultimately paving the way for humanity to become a multiplanetary
        species. We believe that the future of humanity lies beyond the confines
        of our home planet.
