  <p class="h3">Project Mars:</p>
  <p class="h2">
    Mars—the Red Planet—has fascinated humanity for centuries. Its striking
    landscapes, polar ice caps, and mysterious history make it the most
    promising candidate for human colonization beyond Earth. But Mars as it
    exists today is inhospitable: its atmosphere is thin and mostly carbon
    dioxide, temperatures can drop below -100°C, and liquid water is scarce.
    To make it a viable home for humans, we need to terraform it.

<!-- Why Mars Section -->

  <p class="whymars-text">Why Mars?</p>
  <p class="whymars-explanation">
    Mars offers several advantages that make it an ideal candidate for
    colonization. Its day length is similar to Earth's, which would help
    maintain human circadian rhythms. The presence of water ice at its poles
    and beneath its surface could provide essential resources for drinking,
    agriculture, and even fuel production. Additionally, Mars has a variety of
    minerals that could be utilized for construction and manufacturing.
    Establishing a human presence on Mars would serve as a stepping stone
    for further exploration of the solar system. Scientists predict that with
    the right technology and resources, we could begin to terraform Mars within
    the next few centuries.

<!-- Mars Colony Section -->
<div class="container">

  <p class="marscolony-text">
    The first pioneers will land on the red planet with essential building
    materials to form the first colonies on Mars. These colonies will start
    small and expand over time, ultimately becoming thriving cities. Humans
    are known for their adaptability and drive to explore, and Mars represents
    the next great frontier for humanity. With continued advancements in
    technology and collective effort, we can overcome the challenges of living
    on Mars and pave the way for a multiplanetary future.

<!-- Terraforming Section -->
<div class="container">
  <img class="terraforming" src="./images/mars_whymars_d.jpg" alt="Terraforming Mars" />
  <p class="marscolony-text">
    Terraforming Mars will require significant advancements in technology
    and a deep understanding of the planet's environment. Proposed methods
    include releasing greenhouse gases to thicken the atmosphere, introducing
    microorganisms to produce oxygen, and building mirrors in space to reflect
    sunlight onto the surface. These efforts could transform Mars into a
    more hospitable environment, but it is a long-term project requiring
    international cooperation.
